# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there are any trends between city type and the fares that drivers receive.  

## Results

### From the summary data frame, urban cities have many more rides (1,625) than rural (125) or suburban cities (625). Additionally, there are significantly more drivers in urban cities with a higher total fare number. However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are lower in urban cities ($25/$17) compared to rural cities ($35/$55) and suburban cities ($31/$40). From this, because demand is so high in urban cities, the drivers can charge less. (https://github.com/awolfe95/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/total_fare_city_chart.png)

### From the Total Fare by City type line chart, urban cities consistently have higher total fares, with suburban and then rural cities following. All three city types generally follow the same trends across the months. (https://github.com/awolfe95/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Pyber_Summary_DF.png) 


## Summary

### From the findings above, suburban and rural cities do not have as high demand as urban cities. To address this disparity, Pyber could decrease the average fare prices in suburban and rural cities to increase demand. Alternatively, Pyber could increase the average fare prices in suburban and rural cities to make up for the lack fo demand. Finally, Pyber could recruit and increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities to increase supply.
